I"œ<p>The human being by nature enjoys to stay in its comfort zone, and if there are 2 things that fascinates me about technology and self-development. First: we keep evolving our technology to make our lives easier and longer. And second: every time someone has a crazy idea, there will be some guys that will say: â€œItâ€™s impossible! You canâ€™t do it!â€</p>

<p>Previously, I helped to build the JUMIA Online Shopping app, where we were able to prove many people that e-commerce have a great potential in one of the poorest continents that exists, Africa.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I published my first article (<a href="https://proandroiddev.com/google-analytics-with-gtm-and-firebase-b4bdc80a0637">Google Analytics with Tag Manager + Firebase</a>) at a great Android Medium community that is <a href="https://proandroiddev.com">ProAndroidDev</a>.</p>

<p>Before taking the leap into the mobile apps world, I took a licentiate degree in Mechanical Engineering, at â€œUniversidade do Algarveâ€. After having a small experience working in this field, I realised that it wouldnâ€™t fulfil me.</p>

<p>Today I keep growing as an Android Developer at Curve, one of the most exciting places to work that is based in London. As a startup I feel this is a lifetime opportunity to improve my technical skills and to work remotely (I know, I knowâ€¦ typical â€œmillennial kidâ€).</p>

<p>Outside of work, I like to read - some good self-improvement and classic novel books - video games and tv shows. I love dogs (all my life had at least one), greatly admire Japanese culture and Iâ€™m a huge football fan (the great S.L.Benfica).</p>

<p>But Iâ€™m more than thisâ€¦</p>

<p>I can be sure of what I already know, but Iâ€™ve also the humility to learn from other people/sources, and from their perspective. I believe that there is nothing we canâ€™t do if we fight for it with all our strengths and will.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s really important to me to love what I do everyday.</p>

<p>I often ask to myself â€œWhat if there was no money in the world? What would I like to do?â€ For almost 3 years, my answer has been the same: â€œI would create something awesome to help people improve their livesâ€.</p>
