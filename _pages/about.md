The human being by nature enjoys to stay in its comfort zone, and if there are 2 things that fascinates me about technology and self-development. First: we keep evolving our technology to make our lives easier and longer. And second: everytime someone has a crazy idea, there will be some guys that will say: "It's impossible! You can't do it!"

Previously, I helped to build the JUMIA Online Shopping app, where we were able to prove many people that e-commerce have a great potential in one of the poorest continents that exists, Africa.

It was at this time that I published my first article (Google Analytics with Tag Manager + Firebase) at a great Android Medium community that is ProAndroidDev.

Before taking the leap into the mobile apps world, I took a licentiate degree in Mechanical Engineering, at "Universidade do Algarve". After having a small experience working in this field, I realized that it wouldn't fullfill me.

Today I keep growing as an Android Developer at Curve, one of the most exciting places to work that is based in London. As a startup I feel this is a lifetime opportunity to improve my technical skills and to work remotely (I know, I know... typical "millenial kid").

Outside of work, I like to read - some good self-improvement and classic novel books - video games and tv shows. I love dogs (all my life had at least one), greatly admire Japanese culture and I'm a huge football fan (the great S.L.Benfica).

But I'm more than this...

I can be sure of what I already know, but Iâ€™ve also the humility to learn from other people/sources, and from their perspective. I believe that there is nothing we can't do if we fight for it with all our strengths and will.

It's really important to me to love what I do everyday.

I often ask to myself "What if there was no money in the world? What would I like to do?" For almost 3 years, my answer has been the same: "I would create something awesome to help people improve their lives".
