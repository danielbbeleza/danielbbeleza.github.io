## The downfall

 A local company in my hometown gave me the oportunity
 to work as a Project Manager and I was enjoying it a lot in the first couple of months,
 but then things started become worse and worse.


 After some months I was really frustrated and couldn't see myself doing that kind of work,
 for the rest of my life (in other companies), or at the very least, for the next
 couple of years. 

 My thought was: "If I can't even enjoy this job, being the first job, in my hometown, 
 with all the responsabilities that I have, what am I doing here!?"

 Fortunately, something was happening in another place that would greatly influence my
 next step.
