 # ## Introduction
 #
 # As you might have read in my "About" page, I'm a self-taught Android developer
  and started my career on the first months of 2017. 
 # 
 I decided to become an Android developer more than a year after I graduated 
 as a Mechanical Engineer. 

A local company in my hometown was hiring and I decided to work there. That decision was 
what made me want to become an Android developer.

But that story is for another time.

Here are 5 things that I learned in my first self-taught year as an Android developer.


## 1. You can't simply memorize a programming language

After reading a few "how to become an Android Developer" articles, I realised that I needed
to learn Java first (Kotlin was still a bit far of where it is today).

So I went to Amazon, bought a [Head First Java](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0596009208/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0596009208&linkCode=as2&tag=danielbelez0f-21&linkId=e010509d3adc5a2a4e8a5fcba93c7521)
book, and started to read it like a regular book. (If it was today, I would definetely buy it, but the [Kotlin one](https://amzn.to/3kF538v))

Bad decision...

After more or less 2 weeks I was starting to become frustrated and just wanted to play with
some code. I thought I just needed to read and remember later when needed I would remember,
what all functions did, all the existing frameworks, etc.

At the time, I remember that my goal was to "memorize" Java in 6 months.

What a facepalm I'm doing right now, while I remember this.

I was sharing this with someone that was already a developer and he just game the best advice for this:

<cite>You can't simply memorize a dictionary. Just start solving small problems and creating small projects</cite>

That was what I did, and I have to say that it became really helpful. Frustration was now turning 
into motivation because my energy was now being converted in something that I could play with.
