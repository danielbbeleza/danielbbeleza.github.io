## Introduction
 
As you might have read in my "About" page, I'm a self-taught Android developer and started my career on the first months of 2017. 
  
I decided to become an Android developer more than a year after I graduated as a Mechanical Engineer. 

A local company in my hometown was hiring and I decided to work there. That decision was 
what made me want to become an Android developer.

But that story is for another time.

Here are 5 things that I learned the hard way, in my first self-taught year as an Android developer.

<br>
<br>
## 1. Memorizing a programming language

After reading a few "how to become an Android Developer" articles, I realised that I needed
to learn Java first (Kotlin was still a bit far of where it is today).

So I went to Amazon, bought a [Head First Java](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0596009208/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0596009208&linkCode=as2&tag=danielbelez0f-21&linkId=e010509d3adc5a2a4e8a5fcba93c7521)
book, and started to read it like a regular book. (If it was today, I would definetely buy it, but the [Kotlin one](https://amzn.to/3kF538v))

Bad decision...

After more or less 2 weeks I was starting to become frustrated and just wanted to play with
some code. I thought I just needed to read and remember later when needed I would remember,
what all functions did, all the existing frameworks, etc.

At the time, I remember that my goal was to "memorize" Java in 6 months.

What a facepalm I'm doing right now, while I remember this.

I was sharing this with someone that was already a developer and he just gave me the best advice for this:
<br>
<br>
<cite><strong>You can't simply memorize a dictionary. Just start solving small problems and creating small projects</strong></cite>
<br>
<br>
That was what I did, and I have to say that it became really helpful. Frustration was now turning 
into motivation because my energy was now being converted in something that I could play with.

<br>
<br>
## 2. Trying to learn everything alone

I'm the kind of person that prefers to learn things by myself, i.e., doing my own research to 
learn the concepts.

In the first few months, it was ok to do some online courses (at the time, mainly Udacity), 
and to read some tutorials and technical articles in the internet. 

But I didn't had any training in this field, and the most close I came with programming until then, 
was in the university, creating some algorithms in Visual Basic that were "important" to our
career and future as Mechanical Engineers.

Because of this I just followed what "what to learn to be a good Android developer" type of content
were telling me. The problem was that there was lots of technical language that I didn't understood
completely.

That was when I decided to ask help from a real Android developer that I knew.

I went to his house and sat next to him while he was working. He gave a few problems to solve,
and while I was solving these, he showed me why I shouldn't do this or that.

While doing this, it was possible to understand that was A LOT more to know, and whenever 
I had some question it was awesome to have someone experienced next to me to point me in the 
right direction.

In other words, I would say that he was my first mentor and because of him and the knowledge 
he shared with me, I was even able to get my first freelancer project and my first professional 
contract as an Android developer!

So, if I could time travel and talk with my past-self, in the first days, I would say to him:

<br>
<br>
<cite><strong>Best thing you can do for yourself is to get a mentor</strong></cite>
<br>
<br>
This was not only a good thing in the early days, but later I got to work with amazing developers,
that I consider my mentors also.

Everytime I got guided by someone, it was the time I grew the most! Hands-down, the most relevant
decision in my career.

<br>
<br>
## 3. Not learning basic CS concepts

It took a while until I started to understand or even studying basic computer science and programming 
topics such algorithms, networking, object oriented programming, among others.

This was something that I ended learning much later, while I was already working in my first project
as a freelancer and even after, in my first company.

Having these foundations would 

<br>
<br>
## 4. Creating projects 

Fortunately, the online classes I took were pretty decent (Udacity) and while learning Android
concepts I was also building some real projects that were used to show what I was able to do.

Along with these, I was creating a demo app for a restaurant which made me consolidate even more 
the knowledge I was aqcuiring.

It's much more motivating to create an app from your own ideas, then to create one without any purpose.

Creating an app, where you have some features in mind, the app design, the arquitecture (etc), 
will make you search for topics, face problems and make questions, that while following a tutorial 
you wouldn't do.

## Conclusion

I truly believe that consistency is one of the most important things to have if you want be a 
good developer.

The Android world is huge and there's a lot to learn, even more if you don't have any background
or education related to IT. 

If there is something that I've been learning in all these years, is that there isn't a single day
that I don't learn. 

It doesn't really matter if you have a Bachelor or Master's degree on Computer Science. If you want 
to become an Android developer - a frontend, backend, fullstack, whatever... - and you have the passion 
for this, I'm sure you will become a successful programmer!
